# Thyroid Disease Detection using Multi-Layer Perceptron

## Overview

This project aims to develop a thyroid disease detection system using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network. The MLP model is trained on a dataset containing various features extracted from thyroid patients' medical records, with the goal of accurately classifying whether a patient has thyroid disease or not.

## Motivation

With the growing number of credit card users, banks have been facing an escalating credit card default rate. This increase in defaults causes losses to the 
financial institutions along with the card holders. As such data analytics can provide solutions to tackle the current phenomenon and management of credit 
defaults. This project discusses the implementation of an model which predicts if a given credit card
holder has a probability of defaulting in the following month, using their demographic data and
behavioral data from the past 6 months.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from
Garavan Institute

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it here. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using 
the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. 


## Results
The trained MLP model achieved the following performance metrics on the test dataset:

Accuracy: 97% 

F1 Score: 0.97
