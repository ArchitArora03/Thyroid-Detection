# Thyroid Disease Detection using Multi-Layer Perceptron

## Overview

This project aims to develop a thyroid disease detection system using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network. The MLP model is trained on a dataset containing various features extracted from thyroid patients' medical records, with the goal of accurately classifying whether a patient has thyroid disease or not.
*****************************


## Dataset Information
The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from
Garavan Institute

******************************


## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it here. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using 
the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. 
******************************


## Results
The trained MLP model achieved the following performance metrics on the test dataset:

Accuracy: 97% 

F1 Score: 0.97
